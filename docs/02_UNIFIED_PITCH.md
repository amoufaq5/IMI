# UMI - Universal Medical Intelligence
## Unified Pitch Document

---

# 🎯 The One-Liner

**UMI is the first AI platform that connects every stakeholder in healthcare - from a patient's first symptom to a pharmaceutical company's last compliance document - cutting time and cost across the entire medical value chain.**

---

# 📊 The Problem

## Healthcare is Fragmented, Slow, and Expensive

### For Patients
- **4.5 hours** average ER wait time in UK
- **Misdiagnosis** affects 12 million adults annually (US data, similar patterns globally)
- No continuity between GP visits, specialists, and pharmacies

### For Pharmaceutical Companies
- **$2.6 billion** average cost to bring a drug to market
- **40% of time** spent on regulatory documentation, not innovation
- QA/QC compliance is manual, error-prone, and expensive

### For Hospitals
- **30% of ER visits** are non-emergency (could be handled by AI triage)
- Patient history scattered across systems
- Insurance documentation delays treatment

### For Researchers & Students
- **6 months** average time to complete literature review
- Fragmented access to clinical trial data
- No unified platform for medical education
